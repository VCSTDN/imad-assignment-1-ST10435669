The purpose of my history app is it provides information about the great historians when they died could be useful in many ways such as:

 it can be used as an educational tool to learn about the lives of famous historians. Users can explore the ages that these historians passed away, giving context for their life achievements and contributions to history.

Understanding the lifespan of historians can offer insights into the historical periods in which they lived. It can help users understand the historical context within which these scholars developed their ideas and competed their research.

By seeing the times at which great historians died, users may find inspiration or motivation in their own lives  academic or even other things the do. It also allows for comparisons between different historians and their lifespans, which may ignite further reasearch into factors that might have influenced their longevity or impact.

The app can be used by users as a quick referencing tool to gather information about the lifes of multiple different historians without having to dig through multiple sources.

To sum it all up my history app focused on the ages of great historians when they died and can provide valuable information and context for both casual learners and students interested in the field of history.
The app can also be used in classes and lectuers to allow for more of an interactive learning enviroment which may cause students to want to take part and look further into the history of their matched historian.

The purpose of my history app is to show learner and any user fr that matter at what age these great historians past on and to enable them to find the information without users having to dig all over the internet

I chose a simple and user friendly design to allow all ages of individuals to use and understand my app.it has a siple two buttons, a search and a clear button and a text box to output the various ages of past historians death ages.the design is a old looking backround which imitates the old ages and how people pecieve it to look like.i went for this because it is a simple yet informative visual that may relate and bring comfort to users.

GitHub came in use for saving and storing my code which was a safety net as I made a lot of errors and being able to have saves of my files made it a lot more easier for me to explre different ways of coding my app.it allowed me to further my knowledge and create a much smoother working app.
It allowed me to track my changes to the app which allowed me to work more effeciently and at a set pace.
Github allowed me to maintain my project documents which also allowed for more organized tasks and better tracking of my progress allowing me to be more cautious of mistakes and more.
The platform had may engaging member who could show me where I was going wrong and ways to fix my errors this made me a lot more observant when writing my code as I learnt from my previous mistakes and taught me to use differt methodes like ‘if’,’when’ statmentes to enable me to continue my coding without having to keep going back and try finding mistakes and errors in my code.
The platform is easy to use and allows for a much beter experience when coding as it allows for more freedom and play.
Github actions allowed me to move a lot faster as I could build and test my work in one place.
I was able to create personalized workflows tailored to my project which made life a lot easier allowing me to complete faster.
I was able to integrate easily and costomise more freely.
